            We are looking for graduate students interested in computational biology. No formal biology background is necessary, but you must be interested in learning.

            <h3>
            Post-Doctoral Scientist
            </h3>
            <p>
            Join our team to map the yeast genetic interaction network! A computational biology post-doc position is available in the Computational Biology and Functional Genomics group in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota.
            </p>
            <p>
            The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work on an exciting project mapping the global yeast genetic interaction network in collaboration with experimental labs. Our focus will be developing algorithms for inferring biological networks by integrating these large-scale genetic interaction data with other genome-scale data.
            </p>
            <p>
            The ideal candidate would have a computational background with a Ph.D. in Computer Science, Statistics, Physics, Math or Molecular Biology. Substantial experience programming in R, Matlab, Perl, Java or C++ is required. A basic understanding of biology is preferred, but no formal background is necessary as long as he/she has a genuine interest and aptitude for learning about functional genomics. This project is highly collaborative, and thus, strong verbal and written communication skills are essential. Previous experience in data mining or machine learning is a plus.
            </p>
            <p>
            Interested applicants should send a CV with the names of at least three references to Chad Myers (cmyers at cs.umn.edu). Please indicate when you are able to start (as soon as possible is preferred).
