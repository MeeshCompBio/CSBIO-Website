I especially liked that we were provided foundational/background information on why nonparametric methods are good tools and when and why to use them. There was very little math (basic calculus) and the grading system was very fair, we were allowed to drop multiple (though frequent) quizzes which allowed students (like me) who were not necessarily strong in all areas to take this course. Most of the applications were using non-parametric functions in R and being able to interpret the results. Graduate students didn't need to take the final, though were expected to complete a course project (could even be related to what you were working on) </td>

The actual biology behind the approaches is minimal and the course is mostly interested in implementation and what limits we face when creating software for biology. There were a few course projects that took a substantial amount of time as well as challenging tests. If you like to learn by doing, this course would be good for you.

Large focus on implementation of applications, flexible as to what you use to implement. At the end of the course we presented projects of our own design. The course voted for their favorite and the winner got a new printer I think. The prizes made people work a bit harder on their projects I think. Iâ€™ve heard that Rui is not as challenging as Karypis for this course.

I hated taking this course while I was in it, but a few semesters later I still retain some of the important concepts that I ended up learning. It may be that I struggled learning that material at such a high level but I had to really do a lot of outside reading to finish most of the homeworks. I took the class pass/fail but a friend I was taking the course with got similar marks as I did (not spectacular) and ended up getting an A in the course. So, you'll likely learn a lot and can do well in the course as well. There were homeworks due every week and there was a lot of outside work but I did end up learning the basics of statistics.</td>

Most of the lectures were 'chalk talks' and we were also expected to read a couple papers to discuss over the semester. We had ~4-5 homework assignments that were basically word problems that were related to quantitative genetics. We started with a little history of how quantitative genetics emerged as a field and how the theory of population genetics related to quantitative genetics. We then learned the basic theories that hold under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The rest of the semester was focused on deviations away from HW. I learned a lot about quantitative genetics and the overall class and instructor were good. The only criticism is that there was no clear grading structure.

                        Given that the material is very interesting--very theoretical, but still applicable to current genetics research--I was disappointed in this class. Firstly, as Rob mentioned, there was not a clear grading structure, which was particularly problematic because the instructor did not allow students to take the class pass-fail and I felt I was essentially competing with graduate students who are involved in quantitative genetics research. I visited the professor during her office hours and asked specifically how grades and their weights affected our final grade; she refused to answer me. Secondly, class time was not useful. While the overall structure of the lectures made sense, explanations were scattered and the professor was constantly erasing things written on the white board, writing things bottom-to-top and right-to-left, and my notes were useless.

The bulk of the course is spent learning about molecular pathways and how they produce the hallmarks of cancer, as well as characterizing the disease manifestations (different types of cancer, progression of metastasis, etc.). Additionally, it does a great job of simultaneously placing cancer in historical, research, and treatment/prevention contexts, all of which I found very interesting. The structure of the course is typical of introductory biology classes: it relies heavily on straight-up memorization of material from the text book and the grading is solely based on tests (exams every two weeks). This class is not particularly easy and the frequency of the exams means you need to stay on top of the material, but it is all manageable. I enjoyed the class, learned a lot about cancer, and learned a lot about cell biology. </td>

                        (RB) A very good course for people like me who didn't have background in biology / genetics. All students are divided in groups (7-8 students). Heavy coursework which includes two quizzes (one big, one short) and a group assignment each week, starting from week 2 or 3, two projects and a final exam. Lecture videos and slides were posted before the start of the class and students needed to study those to attend the class. Each class started with a quiz (apart from first 1/2 weeks), and then there was kind of review of lectures followed by group works on assignments / projects. The course was of moderate difficulty, but you need to do regular studies to get good grades. Though initial 3-4 weeks were hard for me, I enjoyed and learned a lot eventually.

This class met 3 times a week with an additional discussion section. The discussion section was used to discuss R and how it could be applied to our homework.

The lab works was optional and the TA's provided lab works online for everybody. There was assignments which used skills from lab works, and also there was 2 midterms and a final. Helped me to acquire knowledge or revise on topics like basic probability distributions, different types of hypothesis testing, multiple testing, ranksum test, linear regression etc. Julian recorded and uploaded class lectures himself which helped in case students miss some classes; also all necessary formulas were provided which was great
